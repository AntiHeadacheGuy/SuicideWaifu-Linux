# SuicideWaifu-Linux
Same like Suicide Linux, but everytime you type random Waifu name from waifulabs.com on your terminal, it will execute ``` sudo rm -rf /* ``` and nuke your entire computer
# How
Once you downloaded this repository to your computer, and copy it to ``` .config/fish/config.fish ```
# What happen next
You may ended up in GRUB Rescue or your computer BIOS after typing your Waifu name in Terminal
# Hmm, nothing happens
I doesn't complete the Waifu name yet, also waifulabs.com will match random name so maybe not all I put the Waifu name into the configuration file. This is fish config file, not ``` .bashrc ```
# Windows Version !!!!!!!!
Just if you have WSL and fish installed
